I conduct private tutoring sessions via Skype; below is a list of my past experience tutoring for various institutions. Feel free to take a look at my "[Selected Works](/selected-works)," as I believe they also speak to my academic and pedagogical merit. I take a very Aristotelian, "lived-wisdom" stance on this point.
