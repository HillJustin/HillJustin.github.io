## Guiding Questions

#### Gilles Deleuze [1981]

* What are Deleuzeâ€™s two types of power? (external power which delimits our energies and opportunities [sometimes away from danger]; and internal capacity which enables/empowers us)

* To which two general emotions do these two types of power correlate in direct experience, according to Spinoza? (joy and sadness; wild winds and depressions)
