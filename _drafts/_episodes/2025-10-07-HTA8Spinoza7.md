## Guiding Questions

#### Edward S. Casey [2022]

* Which aspects of affect theory are still unclear?

* How do periphanous models of emotion, of thinking, of consciousness, and of transpersonal interbeing flesh out Spinozism?

* How do edges and peri-phenomenology offer paths forward for thinking affect anew? How do they justify our perceptions and convictions?
