## editing & proofreading

> <div class="text">In an effort to expand my credentials in this section, I am actively seeking philosophical and sociological papers in want of thorough and thoughtful editing. Please get in touch with me from a university email address or via LinkedIn if you would like me to take a complimentary look at your work. <strong>Serious inquiries only.</strong></div>
