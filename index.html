	<p>Thanks for visiting me. I am an artist, a mentor, and a philosopher — i.e., a creative communications director. As an artist and a multimedia creative, I excel at ideation, execution, sensitivity to multiplicity and polyvalence, conception, translation, narrative, aesthetic communication, cohesion, concision, wireframing, creative feedback, voice, style, tone, and taste. As a leader, I am comfortable in all environments. I cannot be made to feel stressed, and I always keep the energy flowing. I consistently cultivate stable environments for my creative teams to produce their best work, and I lead by example with hospitality, integrity, warmth, spirit, prudence, transparency, accountability, and self-respect — with an acute sensitivity to transformational leadership and friendship. As a philosopher and autodidact, I can readily translate any concept into multiple presentations and mediums for multiple communities.</p>
