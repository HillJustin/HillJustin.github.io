	<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Justin Hill, and I am a philosophy M.A. student at Stony Brook University. My primary research interests are Benjamin's philosophy of history and social theory, Spinozan ideology and epistemical-political affect theory, communal and extended theories of the self, social hermeneutics, and anarcha-feminism. More broadly, my research is focused on ideology critique, insofar as belief and action, and thus ethics, are inextricably intertwined, and on the possibility of radical social progress, especially through aesthetics, imagination, and belief.</p>

	<p>Feel free to take a look at some of my <a href="/selected-works">work</a> and <a href="/contact">reach out</a> if you are interested in working together. Warm wishes.</p>
