	<p>Hi there, and welcome to my personal website! I am a full-time philosophy grad student at Stony Brook University, and my research is broadly focused on ideology critique and the possibility of radical social progress, largely through the various mediums of art, rhetoric, and dominant thought patterns. I am also a tutor and freelance writer and editor.</p>
