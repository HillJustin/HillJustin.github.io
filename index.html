			My research interests in transpersonal studies stem from the perplexity of “becoming-with” and explore outward from the nexus of aspectual personhood. By aspectual personhood, I intend the relationships between (i) subject and self (especially pan-selfhood); (ii) body and environment; (iii) affect and belief; (iv) belief and perception; (v) phenomenality and materialism; (vi) formal language and the ineffable; (vii) qualitative languages and direct experience; and (viii) rote dogma [passivity] and enacted intellectual intuition [activity].

			My interest in this nexus takes on a variety of shapes and foci, but what I write is grounded in emphases on process, practice, co-constitution, diversity, inclusion, hospitality, lived experience, and affective necessity, with a strained ear toward any possibilities for transformative communication (such as qualitative languages and the aesthetic communication of semiotic affect). An overarching goal of my work is to open discourse on communitarian personhood — that is, the subject’s experience (of the Itself) as continuously constituted by the subject’s community and environment, which (in aspectual conjunction) can no longer be conceived of as separate and distinct from the subject. I continue a practice of Buddhism, which is deeply intertwined with my experiential research on flow, tantra, samadhi, ineffability, and communitarian personhood. I aim to draw on as many systems of thought as possible to approach the ineffable and to cultivate, for myself and others, the inner beauty of mental experience through profundity and subtlety. To speak allusively, I wish for the music to always sound this good, rich with timbre and texture.

			"Widening Circles"
			by Rainer Maria Rilke,
			from <i>Rilke's Book of Hours: Love Poems to God</i> (1905).
			// //
			I live my life in widening circles /
			that reach out across the world. /
			I may not complete this last one /
			but I give myself to it.
			//
			I circle around God, around the primordial tower. /
			I’ve been circling for thousands of years /
			and I still don’t know: am I a falcon, /
			a storm, or a great song?

			"Vita Nova"
			by Louise Gluck,
			from <i>Vita Nova</i>, (1999).
			// //
			You saved me, you should remember me.
			//
			The spring of the year; young men buying tickets for the ferryboats. /
			Laughter, because the air is full of apple blossoms.
			//
			When I woke up, I realized I was capable of the same feeling.
			//
			I remember sounds like that from my childhood, /
			laughter for no cause, simply because the world is beautiful, /
			something like that.
			//
			Lugano. Tables under the apple trees. /
			Deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags. /
			And by the lake's edge, a young man throws his hat into the water; /
			perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him.
			//
			Crucial /
			sounds or gestures like /
			a track laid down before the larger themes
			//
			and then unused, buried.
			//
			Islands in the distance. My mother /
			holding out a plate of little cakes———
			//
			as far as I remember, changed /
			in no detail, the moment /
			vivid, intact, having never been /
			exposed to light, so that I woke elated, at my age /
			hungry for life, utterly confident———
			//
			By the tables, patches of new grass, the pale green /
			pieced into the dark existing ground.
			//
			Surely spring has been returned to me, this time /
			not as a lover but a messenger of death, yet /
			it is still spring, it is still meant tenderly.
			// //
