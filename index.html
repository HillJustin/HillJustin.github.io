	<p>Areas of interest: Spinoza, Marx, Walter Benjamin, Julia Kristeva, Deleuze, Critical Theory, philosophy of history, ideology and epistemic-political affect theory (i.e. belief and agency), historical and communitarian theories of the Self, critical (sociopolitical) aesthetics, the possibility of critique, Marxist hermeneutics, materialism, critical history of philosophy and weak Messianism (i.e. reinterpreting canon as a form of social critique)</p>

	<p>My work focuses on Spinozan epistemic-political affect theory and other desubjectifying and communitarian theories of the Self. I am primarily interested in better understanding and explicating the mechanisms of social critique through art and media, all in pursuing what I often refer to as the possibilities of critique and of social progress. I also approach these questions in my work through the avenues of historically-grounded ideology critique and of Marxist hermeneutics.</p>

	<p>Feel free to take a look at some of my <a href="/selected-works">work</a> and <a href="/contact">reach out</a> if you are interested in working together. Warm wishes.</p>
