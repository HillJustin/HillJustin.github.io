	<p>Thank you for reading me. I am presently seeking a leadership position which affords me with ample opportunities to drive conception, foster collaborative energy, strengthen social directions, and nurture public health.</p>

	<p>In May 2019, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Philosophy, with a minor in Sociology and with <em>summa cum laude</em> honors, from the University of Houston-Downtown. Having already satisfied all curricular requirements to attain a master’s degree in Philosophy and the Arts from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, I am enrolled in one credit-hour to graduate this May.</p>

	<p>In the past, I have driven growth and rebuilt engagement through hospitality and vulnerability — particularly during my tenures as Director of Marketing Communications for the M.A. Program in Philosophy and the Arts at Stony Brook University and as President of the International Honor Society for Philosophy at the University of Houston-Downtown. I have also affected substantive research and policy recommendations on parenting and family well-being for Children at Risk.</p>

	<p>As a professionally trained philosopher, I wield expertise in results-oriented communication, observation, and self-learning. As a transformational mentor, I lead by example with devoted hospitality, transparent integrity, and mutual accountability. I always show up to meet the day. As an artist, I am intimately familiar with creative processes, and I purposefully cultivate stable environments for my teams to thrive and uncover their best work alongside my intentional care.</p>

	<p>Thank you for taking the time to read me. I can be reached by phone at (254) 459-9632 and by email at Hill.Justin.Andrew@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

	<p>Ready, willing, and able,</p>

	<p>Justin Hill</p>
