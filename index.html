	<p>Thanks for visiting me. I am an artist, a mentor, and a philosopher — i.e., a creative communications director. As a multimedia creative, I excel at conception, process thinking, execution, experimentation, multiplicity, polyvalence, translation, interpretation, narrative, aesthetic communication, cohesion, concision, wireframing, creative feedback, voice, style, tone, and taste. As a leader, I am comfortable in all environments, and I cannot be made to feel stressed. I always keep the energy flowing, and I consistently cultivate stable environments for my creative teams to produce their best work. Most importantly, I wield an acute sensitivity to transformational leadership and friendship, and I lead by example with hospitality, devotion, integrity, warmth, spirit, prudence, transparency, accountability, and self-respect to show up regardless of outcomes. As a philosopher and an autodidact, I can readily translate any concept into multiple presentations and multiple mediums for multiple communities with multiple histories.</p>
