	<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Justin Hill, and I am a philosophy M.A. student at Stony Brook University. My research is broadly focused on ideology critique and the possibility of radical social progress, especially through aesthetics, imagination, and belief. Naturally, this also leads to strong interests in affect theory, phenomenology, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, and subjectivity on the whole.</p>

	<p>Feel free to take a look at my <a href="/selected-works">work</a> and <a href="/contact">reach out</a> if you are interested in working together. All the best.</p><br>
