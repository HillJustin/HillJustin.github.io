## Guiding Questions

* Why can I not doubt cogito ergo sum, or I am thinking, therefore I exist?

* How do we know the wax is the same wax after changing form through
melting?

* How does our judgment-perception of the automatons prove that all sense
perception is actually and has always actually been mental judgment?

* What does this say about our perception, cognition, and mind in relation to the
world we believe is external to us? In other words, are our worlds truly external?

* Is our belief that worlds are external to us sufficient evidence to prove they are?

* Are there any experiences which do not count as thinking or mental activity
[in the Second Meditation]? Can we access non-thinking reality, non-thought?
