## Guiding Questions

#### Baruch Spinoza [1677]

* How does affect refer to emotion, gesture, mood, feeling, impact, cause, effect, capacity, potential, power, and knowledge all at once?

* How does affect get at self-other all at once in the simultaneity of (1)affecting-(2)being-affected, i.e., (1)being-affected-(2)affecting?

* How does affect offer conceptual constructions for a non-linear and zonal metaphysics, i.e., how does affect allow us to think about environments and systems of causation more fluidly and flexibly as a field rather than as causal ‘arrow’ or throughline? Use an example.

* How does individual and environmental historicity impact affect and freedom?
