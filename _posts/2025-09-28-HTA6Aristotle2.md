## Guiding Questions

* How does eudaimonia mean happiness but not hedonistic/egoistic pleasure?

* How does “the mean” of virtue allow just action to depend on history/context?

* What are the three types of friendship, and which type is most ethical/just?

* What are the roles of habit and practice in the formation of enacted virtue?

* Why must reason be enacted, and how does this enacted reason relate to a
diversity of pleasures unique to each activity, pleasant in the doing itself?
