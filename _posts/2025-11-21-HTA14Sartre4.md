## Guiding Questions


#### Introduction

* Why is phenomenology better suited than psychology to offer a complete account of human-reality, the world as synthetic totality, and self-conscious subjectivity (i.e., consciousness)?


#### I. The Classical Theories

* What is the finality of emotion?

* Why are James’s peripheric theory and Janet’s intellectualist theory of emotion similarly inadequate solutions to the mind-body problem, for the same reason?

* What is Sartre’s alternative, which is an adaptation of Janet’s theory?


#### II. The Psychoanalytic Theory

* Why is the psychoanalytic theory of emotion as an unconscious resolution of drives, urges, impulses, or tensions still inadequate?


#### III. Outline of a Phenomenological Theory; Conclusion

* How does emotion as a transformation of the world imply and provide evidence for the reality of the magical world, i.e., for the world as fundamentally magical?
