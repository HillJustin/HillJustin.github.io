title: HTA 0.0; PHIL Overview and Concise Launch
abstract: This episode is the overview episode [HTA 0.0] which introduces the entire HTA lecture podcast by connecting all components briefly and concisely to launch any philosophy course. HTA 0.1-0.2 introduce myself and my background, and HTA 0.3 introduces the intended workflow between readings, annotations, guiding questions, exit tickets, and timed essay exams. HTA 0.4-0.9 are content-specific overviews for unique reading lists and course designs, independent of the structure of assessment and studying, which should stay consistent for all courses, e.g., HTA 0.3. Again, 0.0 connects these.
