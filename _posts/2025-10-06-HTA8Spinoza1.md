## Guiding Questions

#### Baruch Spinoza [1677]

* How does affect refer to emotion, gesture, mood, feeling, impact, cause, effect, capacity, potential, power, and knowledge all at once?

* How does affect get at self-other all at once in the simultaneity of (1)affecting-(2)being-affected, i.e., (1)being-affected-(2)affecting?

* How does affect offer conceptual constructions for a non-linear and zonal metaphysics, i.e., how does affect allow us to think about environments and systems of causation more fluidly and flexibly as a field rather than as causal ‘arrow’ or throughline? Use an example.

* How does individual and environmental historicity impact affect and freedom?


#### Walter Benjamin [1940]

* What is *weak* messianism? How does it differ from *strong* messianism?

* How can the dead speak again (through re-interpretation)?

* What do we owe to the dead and the suffered?

* How do history and interpretation impact affect? How does affect impact history and interpretation?


#### Gilles Deleuze [1981]

* What are Deleuze’s two types of power? (external power which delimits our energies and opportunities [sometimes away from danger]; and internal capacity which enables/empowers us)

* To which two general emotions do these two types of power correlate in direct experience, according to Spinoza? (joy and sadness; wild winds and depressions)


#### Brian Massumi [2015]

* How does Massumi bring Spinozan affect into process-relational thought?

* What real-world impacts does affect theory have? What crises does affect theory (e.g., Spinoza, Benjamin, Deleuze, Massumi, Whitman) resolve or inform?

* How can understanding historicized zonal process affect aid global well-being?


#### Justin A. Hill [2019]

* Why does Benjamin argue passive absorption is more effective than active contemplation, which Adorno nevertheless defends?

* How does Spinozan affect theory defend Benjamin's position from Adorno's critique?


#### Edward S. Casey [2022]

* Which aspects of affect theory are still unclear?
