title: HTA 0.1; PHIL Overview and Concise Launch
abstract: This episode [HTA 0.1] is the concise overview which introduces the entire HTA lecture podcast by connecting all components briefly to launch any philosophy course. HTA 0.2-0.3 introduce myself and my background, and HTA 0.4 introduces the intended workflow between readings, guiding questions, lectures, annotations, exit tickets, and timed essay exams. HTA 0.5-0.9 are content-specific overviews for unique reading lists and course designs, independent of the structure of assessment and studying, e.g., HTA 0.4, which stays consistent for all courses. Again, 0.1 connects all these.
