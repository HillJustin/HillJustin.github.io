*Nota bene: Anyone can feel free to write the article from this wireframe. Feel free to contact me about any questions you may have, as it would be more readily within my present capacities to talk about this synchronously.*

Outline:

* Inauguration: showers, rituals, and John Wick post-Continental

* Conception: Love, creation, emanation, intellection, crystallization, activity and passivity, perception, necessity, birth, and biological creation
