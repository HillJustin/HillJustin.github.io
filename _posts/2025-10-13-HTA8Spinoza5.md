## Guiding Questions

#### Brian Massumi [2015]

* How does Massumi bring Spinozan affect into process-relational thought?

* What real-world impacts does affect theory have? What crises does affect theory (e.g., Spinoza, Benjamin, Deleuze, Massumi, Whitman) resolve or inform?

* How can understanding historicized zonal process affect aid global well-being?
