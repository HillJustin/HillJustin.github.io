title: "*eros*"
abstract: This essay develops an erotics of friendship that is at once also an erotics of art and an erotics of religious experience, by working with the thinking of María Lugones, Audre Lorde, Plato, bell hooks, Alfred North Whitehead, Aristotle, Susan Sontag, Gloria Anzaldúa, John Dewey, Jean-Luc Nancy, Henri Bergson and Baruch Spinoza. / Nota bene: From here down, I still need to incorporate Plato, Whitehead, and Aristotle, after choosing to expand from three divisions into four. Each movement could be written as a 3-5 page section within an essay or as a 3-chapter part within a book. / In our first movement, Lugones, Lorde, and hooks articulate an erotics of friendship through lenses of devotion, turning toward, and mentorship. In our second movement, Sontag articulates an erotics of art in contrast with a hermeneutics interpreting art, as well as transparence as divine sense of intuition in perception, and Anzaldúa articulates an erotics of sublime, transformative storytelling, as well as a world-erotic understood through metaphors of entering the serpent and of becoming Coatlicue, practiced by attuning a global multiplicity of energy. Dewey articulates an erotics of art through the esthetic as consummate experience. In our third movement, Nancy articulates an existential erotics of being-with the origin, of being abandoned by the gods, and of loving each other with affectionately curious “world”-traveling; Bergson articulates the intuition of concrete duration as a site of erotic access to the Absolute; and Spinoza articulates the fullness of our erotic God, drawn to the limits of perception, sense, matter, existence, and “world,” in the perfection of the real, i.e., in the perfection of the erotic-esthetic-intuitive-material-devotional-mentorial-memorial-platonic-divine-experiential Absolute. / I argue for erotic, platonic, demi-sexual, poly-relational love as a metaphysical principle of experience, existence, and matter. I argue that we must turn toward embodied desire, attraction, and feeling, aspects of our shared *eros*, in order to achieve social justice, global harmony, personal fulfillment, and moral sense.
