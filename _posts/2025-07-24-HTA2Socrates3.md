## Guiding Questions

* How is Socrates able to confidently (i.e., with “serene spiritual and moral beauty of character”) face whatever may come his way, including his probable death-sentence and impending death?

* Why can no one harm Socrates, and how is this inability to be harmed related to the human soul's virtue?
