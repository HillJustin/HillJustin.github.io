## Guiding Questions

#### Ch. 1, The Live Creature

* How does mind-body dualism separate art from everyday experience and thereby estrange the live creature from intrinsic spiritual fulfillment?

  * Compartmentalization of life prevents esthetic consummation and privatizes access to what should be a universal right to fulfillment. The spiritual is a refinement of the material, in a living body.
