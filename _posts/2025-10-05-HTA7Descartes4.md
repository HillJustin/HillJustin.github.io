* How do I know God exists, and why does it lead to the Cartesian circle?

* What is the Cartesian Circle?

* What is clarity and distinctness?

* What is the difference between objective and formal reality?

* Why must there be at least as much reality in the cause as in the effect?

resolve the Cartesian Circle differently if understanding is partaking of God?

* How is rationalism different from empiricism?
