## Guiding Questions

* How do I know God exists, and why does it lead to the Cartesian circle?

* What is the Cartesian Circle?

* What is clarity and distinctness?

* What is the difference between objective and formal reality?

* Why must there be at least as much reality in the cause as in the effect?

* How does Descartes go from qualitative to categorical justification?

* What is the relationship between henosis and the natural light? What is the
relation between henosis, the natural light, and clarity and distinctness? Do we
resolve the Cartesian Circle differently if understanding is partaking of God?

* How is rationalism different from empiricism?
