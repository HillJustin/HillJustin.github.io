  title: "Holy Terrain Art"
  subtitle: "Philosophical Sketches of Transpersonal Being-With"
  description: "A philosophy podcast, sometimes taken for college credit and always available for free at HillJ.net/hta/. Annotated excerpts of primary sources (for reading along with) are also available, at HillJ.net/teaching/. Visual art and lecture notes are available on Instagram.com/HolyTerrainArt. Episodes are numbered in base-ten for each lecture series; in practice, this numbering system means that when an episode starts reading a new primary source, the episode numbers start at a new base-ten, e.g., 21, 31, 41, etc.; base-ten episode numbering allows sub-series to be organized like decimals even though some platforms require integer episode numbering; sometimes, not all episode numbers are utilized in this system before starting a new series and before jumping ahead to the next base-ten -- unused numbers allows me to add more later."
  summary: "This podcast is concurrent with curriculi in higher education, adhering to accreditation standards across multiple institutions and systems."
