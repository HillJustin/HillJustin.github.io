  title: "Holy Terrain Art"
  subtitle: "Philosophical Sketches of Transpersonal Being-With"
  description: "Holy Terrain Art is a philosophy podcast, sometimes taken for university-level credit and always available for free at HillJ.net/hta. Teacher exemplary annotations of primary sources are available at HillJ.net/teaching; you can follow along with these during the lectures. Visual art and lecture notes are available at Instagram.com/HolyTerrainArt. Episodes are numbered via canons of base-ten for each lecture series; in practice, this numbering system means that, when the podcast starts reading a new primary source, the episode numbers reset at the next base-ten, e.g., 11, 21, 31, 41, etc., each base-ten of which corresponds with the series numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., respectively; base-ten episode numbering allows sub-series to be organized like decimals even though some platforms require episodes be numbered using only integers; sometimes this numbering system results in not all episode numbers being utilized in a base-ten set before starting a new series and before jumping ahead to the next base-ten; e.g., HTA Series 1, on Bergson, is seven episodes, so 18-20 are skipped, holding space to add more later."
  summary: "This podcast is concurrent with curriculi in higher education, adhering to accreditation standards across multiple institutions and systems."
