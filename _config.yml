  title: "Holy Terrain Art"
  subtitle: "Philosophical Sketches of Transpersonal Being-With"
  description: "A philosophy podcast, sometimes taken for college credit. Annotated excerpts of primary sources (for reading along with) are available on HillJ.net/teaching/. Visual art and lecture notes are available on Instagram @HolyTerrainArt. Episodes are numbered in base-ten for each lecture series; in practice, this means that when the podcast starts a new primary source, the episode numbers start at a new base-ten, e.g., 21; base-ten episode numbering allows sub-series to be organized using these 'psuedo'-decimals; sometimes, not all episode numbers are utilized before starting a new series and jumping ahead to the next base-ten, allowing me to add more later."
  summary: "This podcast is concurrent with curriculi in higher education, adhering to accreditation standards across multiple institutions and systems."
