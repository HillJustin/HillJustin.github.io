Experiment in self-disruption and stoic crystallization which explored philosophical method, lateral thinking, the importance of historicized and experienced affect, the relationship between personal choice and synchronistic world-consequences, and the valid remainder of sustaining an I-being alongside a we-being in the lived sense of being singular plural.

* *Holy Terrain*. Ongoing campaign. [@holyTerrainArt](https://www.Instagram.com/holyTerrainArt/). Collaborative art collective. 2022. Advocated for conceptions of art and creation as co-constitutive practices of love-as-existence, articulated by beings sharing Being. Emphasized the role of *eros* in producing collaborative work.
